# multi player snake game (TRON)

## Premise
Two snakes, eating food to gradually get bigger and block the other opponent with their bodies to win the game.

## Usage
1. Run the snake server on a specified port, i.e. `.\snake_server 6012`;
2. Run the snake client on a specified ip and port, i.e. `.\snake_client 127.0.0.1 6012` on two clients
3. That's it!


## Environment requirements:
- Any linux will do, not sure if it'll work on windows :-)
